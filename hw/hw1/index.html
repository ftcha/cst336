                    It seems like every year a large corporation is hacked, <br />
                    causing a massive data breach.  One of the most recent <br />
                    data breach was Equifax.  Data exposed during the breach <br />
                    were personal information such as social security numbers, <br />
                    addresses, and birth dates.  One would think that a <br />
                    corporation such as Equifax would have one of the highest <br />
                    level of cyber security in place considering the data it <br />
                    is storing.  That was not the case with Equifax, which <br />
                    makes cyber security one of the top topic yearly.<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/data-breach/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html" id="sourceURL"> -source </a>

                    Join us as we look at how hackers plan, execute, and <br />
                    expose data.  We also look at next generation firewalls <br />
                    and software solutions to prevent such attacks from <br />
                    hackers.
